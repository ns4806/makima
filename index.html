      	<h2>Who Exactly is Makima?</h2>
      	<p>Makima is one of the strongest individuals in the world of Chainsaw Man thanks to her physical and supernatural abilities as a devil, along with her cunning and manipulative personality. She is feared by humans, fiends and devils all around the world, which increases her powers as a devil.</p>

      	<h2>What Abilities Does Makima Possess?</h2>
      	<ol>
      		<li>Much like the other devils, Makima possesses common abilities such as regeneration, super strength, and the ability to form contracts with humans. However, Makima is no ordinary devil; she’s a Control Devil and a part of the Four Horsemen, meaning she’s incredibly powerful.</li>
      	</ol>

      	<!-- Makima's True Goal -->
      	<h2>What is Makima’s True Goal?</h2>
      	<p>Not long after she’s introduced, it is revealed that Makima is an extreme fan of Chainsaw Man, the “Hero of Hell”. She is fascinated by his ability to consume the embodied concept of a devil, wiping it out in the process. In addition, devils consumed by the Chainsaw Man could not be reincarnated. The Control Devil aims to control Chainsaw Man to create an ideal world without fear and death. Throughout the initial arc, she’s seen trying to manipulate Denji through promises of romance and even goes as far as threatening him with extermination for disobedience. However, it’s not Denji that she’s interested in. It’s Pochita, the Chainsaw Devil and the original Chainsaw Man, that she's after. Click on the links below to learn more about her:</p>
